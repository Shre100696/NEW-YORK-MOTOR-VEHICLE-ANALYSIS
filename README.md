# NEW-YORK-MOTOR-VEHICLE-ANALYSIS


Project Description
This project is an in-depth analysis of the NYC Motor Vehicle (MV) Collisions data, encompassing the exploration of crashes, vehicles, and individual persons involved. The aim is to derive meaningful insights into the patterns and causes of traffic incidents in New York City and to support the development of strategies for improving road safety.

Data Sources
The data for this project was sourced from the NYC Open Data platform, which provides detailed records of collisions including:

MV Collisions - Crashes
MV Collisions - Vehicles
MV Collisions - Person
Workflows and Tools
The analysis involved several stages:

Data Profiling with Alteryx: Initial examination of the datasets to understand the structure, content, and quality.
Staging Table Loads with Talend: Data was loaded into staging tables, and SQL scripts were utilized for table creation.
Dimensional Modeling: Designing a preliminary dimensional model and mapping stage table columns to the model.
Data Cleansing: Using Talend for cleaning and validating the data, including handling surrogate keys and data quality issues.
Integration Schema Loads: Migrating data from staging tables to an integration schema based on a dimensional model using Talend.
Deliverables
Screenshots of completed data profiling, loads, and Talend jobs.
Documentation of data cleansing tasks and results.
Execution time records for each task and job.
List of tables with row counts after data loads.
Answers to business queries using the integration schema.
Business Questions
The project focused on a series of business questions, aiming to uncover insights related to collision counts, injuries, fatalities, vehicle types, and temporal trends, among others. Queries and visualizations were crafted to address questions such as the frequency of accidents by borough, the time of day when accidents are most likely to happen, and the commonality of accidents involving specific types of road users like bicyclists, pedestrians, and motorcyclists.

Visualizations and Reporting
Interactive dashboards were created using Tableau Online and Power BI Service to visualize the data and answer the business questions. Maps, treemaps, bar charts, scatterplots, and textual reports were included to provide a comprehensive view of the findings.

Usage
The project's outputs are designed to aid policymakers, urban planners, and public safety officials in making informed decisions to enhance road safety in NYC.
